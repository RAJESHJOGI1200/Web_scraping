## Project Overview

The objectives of this project are:
- Scrape the medals table from **Wikipedia**.
- Store the data in an **Excel .csv format**.
- Import the .csv file into **MySQL Workbench** for analysis.
- Perform SQL-based analysis to extract meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:**
  - Extracted medal counts by country from Wikipedia.
  - Data includes the following fields:
    - `country_name`: Name of the country.
    - `gold`: Number of gold medals.
    - `silver`: Number of silver medals.
    - `bronze`: Number of bronze medals.
    - `total_count`: Total medals won by the country.

- **SQL Analysis:**
  - **Top Countries:** Identify countries with the highest medal counts.
  - **Medal Distribution:** Analyze gold, silver, and bronze medal trends.
  - **Rankings:** Generate a medal table ranking based on total medal counts.
